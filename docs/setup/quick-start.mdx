# Quick Setup

Welcome to the Ethereal SDK quick setup guide! Follow these steps to install, configure, and run your first agentic AI system.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+** (Check your version with `python --version`)
- **Git** (Optional, for cloning the repository)
- **pip or Poetry** (For managing dependencies)

If Python is not installed, you can download it from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Step 1: Clone the Repository (Optional)

If you want to get the latest version from GitHub, run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ethereal-sdk.git
cd ethereal-sdk
```

## Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

To avoid dependency conflicts, it's recommended to create a virtual environment:

```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

You can install the dependencies using either pip or Poetry.

Using pip:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or using Poetry:

```sh
poetry install
```

## Step 4: Run Examples

After installation, try running a sample agent to ensure everything is set up properly.

```sh
python -m examples.integration_example
```
